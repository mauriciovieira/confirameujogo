	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Simple Access Control List

	This module provides utilities to manage permissions for anything that
	requires some level of restriction, such as datastore models or handlers.

	Access permissions can be grouped into roles for convenience, so that a new
	user can be assigned to a role directly instead of having all
	permissions defined manually. Individual access permissions can then
	override or extend the role permissions.

	.. note::

	   Roles are optional, so this module doesn't define a roles model (to keep
	   things simple and fast). Role definitions are set directly in the Acl
	   class. The strategy to load roles is open to the implementation; for
	   best performance, define them statically in a module.

	Usage example::

		# Set a dict of roles with an 'admin' role that has full access and
		# assign users to it. Each role maps to a list of rules. Each rule is a
		# tuple (topic, name, flag), where flag is as bool to allow or disallow
		# access. Wildcard '*' can be used to match all topics and/or names.
		Acl.roles_map = {
			'admin': [
				('*', '*', True),
			],
		}

		# Assign users 'user_1' and 'user_2' to the 'admin' role.
		AclRules.insert_or_update(area='my_area', user='user_1',
			roles=['admin'])
		AclRules.insert_or_update(area='my_area', user='user_2',
			roles=['admin'])

		# Restrict 'user_2' from accessing a specific resource, adding a new
		# rule with flag set to False. Now this user has access to everything
		# except this resource.
		user_acl = AclRules.get_by_area_and_user('my_area', 'user_2')
		user_acl.rules.append(('UserAdmin', '*', False))
		user_acl.put()

		# Check that 'user_2' permissions are correct.
		acl = Acl(area='my_area', user='user_2')
		assert acl.has_access(topic='UserAdmin', name='save') is False
		assert acl.has_access(topic='AnythingElse', name='put') is True

	The Acl object should be created once after a user is loaded, so that
	it becomes available for the app to do all necessary permissions checkings.

	Based on concept from `Solar <http://solarphp.com>`_ Access and Role
	classes.
