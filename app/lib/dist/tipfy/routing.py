        and are passed to the `Rule` constructor. Note that besides the
        rule-string all arguments *must* be keyword arguments in order to not
        break the application on upgrades.

        :param path:
            Rule strings basically are just normal URL paths with placeholders
            in the format ``<converter(arguments):name>`` where the converter
            and the arguments are optional. If no converter is defined the
            `default` converter is used which means `string` in the normal
            configuration.

            URL rules that end with a slash are branch URLs, others are leaves.
            If you have `strict_slashes` enabled (which is the default), all
            branch URLs that are matched without a trailing slash will trigger a
            redirect to the same URL with the missing slash appended.

            The converters are defined on the `Map`.
        :param name:
            The rule name used for URL generation.
        :param handler:
            The handler class or function used to handle requests when this
            rule matches. Can be defined as a string to be lazily imported.
        :param handler_method:
            The method to be executed from the handler class. If not defined,
            defaults to the current request method in lower case.
        :param defaults:
            An optional dict with defaults for other rules with the same
            endpoint. This is a bit tricky but useful if you want to have
            unique URLs::

                rules = [
                    Rule('/all/', name='pages', handler='handlers.PageHandler', defaults={'page': 1}),
                    Rule('/all/page/<int:page>', name='pages', handler='handlers.PageHandler'),
                ]

            If a user now visits ``http://example.com/all/page/1`` he will be
            redirected to ``http://example.com/all/``. If `redirect_defaults`
            is disabled on the `Map` instance this will only affect the URL
            generation.
        :param subdomain:
            The subdomain rule string for this rule. If not specified the rule
            only matches for the `default_subdomain` of the map. If the map is
            not bound to a subdomain this feature is disabled.

            Can be useful if you want to have user profiles on different
            subdomains and all subdomains are forwarded to your application.
        :param methods:
            A sequence of http methods this rule applies to. If not specified,
            all methods are allowed. For example this can be useful if you want
            different endpoints for `POST` and `GET`. If methods are defined
            and the path matches but the method matched against is not in this
            list or in the list of another rule for that path the error raised
            is of the type `MethodNotAllowed` rather than `NotFound`. If `GET`
            is present in the list of methods and `HEAD` is not, `HEAD` is
            added automatically.
        :param strict_slashes:
            Override the `Map` setting for `strict_slashes` only for this rule.
            If not specified the `Map` setting is used.
        :param build_only:
            Set this to True and the rule will never match but will create a
            URL that can be build. This is useful if you have resources on a
            subdomain or folder that are not handled by the WSGI application
            (like static data).
        :param redirect_to:
            If given this must be either a string or callable. In case of a
            callable it's called with the url adapter that triggered the match
            and the values of the URL as keyword arguments and has to return
            the target for the redirect, otherwise it has to be a string with
            placeholders in rule syntax::

                def foo_with_slug(adapter, id):
                    # ask the database for the slug for the old id. this of
                    # course has nothing to do with werkzeug.
                    return 'foo/' + Foo.get_slug_for_id(id)

                rules = [
                    Rule('/foo/<slug>', name='foo', handler='handlers.FooHandler'),
                    Rule('/some/old/url/<slug>', redirect_to='foo/<slug>'),
                    Rule('/other/old/url/<int:id>', redirect_to=foo_with_slug)
                ]

            When the rule is matched the routing system will raise a
            `RequestRedirect` exception with the target for the redirect.

            Keep in mind that the URL will be joined against the URL root of
            the script so don't use a leading slash on the target URL unless
            you really mean root of that domain.
